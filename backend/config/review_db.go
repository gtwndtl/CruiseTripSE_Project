The orange juice was fresh, tangy, and well-balanced, offering a natural sweetness that was invigorating. It paired wonderfully with the rich and flavorful steak, which was cooked to perfection with a beautiful sear and tender inside. The steak had just the right amount of seasoning, enhancing the natural taste without overwhelming it. Together, these two made for a deliciously satisfying meal that was both refreshing and hearty. Highly recommended!",
